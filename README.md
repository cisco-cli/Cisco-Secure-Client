## Deploying Cisco Secure Client

Cisco Secure Client, formerly known as AnyConnect, is engineered to deliver secure access for remote users. It features advanced security capabilities and stable connectivity for enterprise networks. This guide outlines deployment procedures, configuration steps, and common troubleshooting practices.

## Cisco Secure Client Deployment Methods

Deployment of Cisco Secure Client varies depending on infrastructure and business needs:

> **Predeployment**: The software is installed manually or using enterprise-level software management tools (SMS).

> **Web Deployment**: The client is automatically installed when users connect to devices such as Secure Firewall ASA, ISE, or Threat Defense.

> **Cloud Management Deployment**: The client is deployed and maintained via the Cisco Secure Client Cloud Management platform.

Each deployment strategy comes with its own set of benefits and prerequisites, which are discussed in the following sections.

## Predeploying Cisco Secure Client

Predeployment refers to the manual or automated installation of Cisco Secure Client using tools like an enterprise software management suite.

### Predeployment Process:
1. **Download the Predeployment Package**  
   - Available for download through Cisco’s official portal.

2. **Install the Necessary Modules**  
   - VPN  
   - Network Access Manager  
   - ISE Posture  
   - Network Visibility Module  

3. **Distribute Configuration Profiles**  
   - Profiles should be consistently synchronized between client endpoints and headend systems (ASA, ISE).

4. **Deploy with SCCM or Equivalent Tools**  
   - Use SMS platforms like SCCM for streamlined deployments.

5. **Confirm Successful Installation**  
   - Verify that the client has been installed and is functioning properly.

## Web Deploying Cisco Secure Client

Web deployment enables installation of Cisco Secure Client during user connection to a headend device such as ASA or ISE.

### Web Deployment Procedure:
1. **Upload the installation package to ASA or ISE.**  
2. **Set up deployment parameters and policies on the headend device.**  
3. **Users log in to the headend web portal and initiate the download.**  
4. **Installation completes automatically upon connection.**

> [!info] **Note:** An active internet connection and access to the headend system are required for web deployment.

## Updating Cisco Secure Client Software and Profiles

Keeping Cisco Secure Client updated is essential for maintaining security, feature support, and system compatibility.

### Update Options:
- **Automatic Update via ASA or ISE**  
  - Updates are retrieved during VPN sessions.

- **Manual Update**  
  - Users download and apply updates manually from Cisco’s site.

- **Enterprise Software Management Update**  
  - Centralized updates are managed through an SMS platform.

## Configuring Cisco Secure Client Modules

Cisco Secure Client includes various modules that can be customized to meet specific security policy requirements.

### Available Modules:
- **VPN Module**: Ensures secure remote network access.  
- **Network Access Manager**: Controls and enforces network access policies.  
- **ISE Posture**: Validates endpoint compliance with security standards.  
- **Network Visibility Module (NVM)**: Gathers network telemetry for analysis.  
- **Umbrella Roaming Security Module**: Provides DNS-layer protection via Cisco Umbrella.

### VPN Module Configuration:
```xml
<VPNProfile>
    <ServerList>
        <HostEntry>
            <HostName>vpn.company.com</HostName>
            <HostAddress>192.168.1.1</HostAddress>
        </HostEntry>
    </ServerList>
</VPNProfile>
```

## Managing Profiles and Policies

Profiles and policies ensure Cisco Secure Client adheres to organizational security protocols.

### Profile Management:
- **VPN Profiles**: Define server addresses and authentication methods.  
- **ISE Posture Profiles**: Specify device compliance requirements.  
- **Network Visibility Profiles**: Configure data collection parameters.

### Policy Management:
- Policies are set up on **ASA, ISE, or the Secure Client Cloud Management platform**.  
- They govern access rights, authentication mechanisms, and security rules.

## Security and Compliance Considerations

Cisco Secure Client incorporates several features to safeguard devices and enterprise infrastructure.

### Core Security Features:
- **Multi-factor Authentication (MFA)**: Adds a layer of identity verification.  
- **Endpoint Compliance Checks**: Ensures devices follow defined security protocols.  
- **Encrypted Communication**: Utilizes SSL and IPsec protocols for secure data transmission.

> [!important] **Only allow VPN access from endpoints that comply with security policies.**

## Troubleshooting Cisco Secure Client
